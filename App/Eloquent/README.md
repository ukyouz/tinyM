A PHP framework with Model.

This is a simple PHP framework inspired by Laravel. Now we offer some Classes in our work, here list some usages of example. Hope these help you get an general idea of this simple framework.

## App\Eloquent

before using any of Models under folder `App\`, you need to include these files by an `autoload.php` located in folder `vender/`, and then `use` with their correct paths.
